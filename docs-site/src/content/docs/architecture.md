description: Public architecture of KynticAI Scout and its open-source data-plane boundary.
---

KynticAI Scout is the public, MIT-licensed data-plane foundation for the
Universal Context Layer. It runs beside existing operational systems,
turns approved source records into governed semantic context and evidence,
and exposes that context through GraphQL, REST, SDKs, and context packages.

Scout's core context pipeline does not call an AI model. Its job is to give
customer-owned applications, reports, workflows, local LLMs, agents, and
AI-enabled products a trusted memory layer with provenance and confidence. Optional
demo workflows can consume Scout context, but context generation remains
grounded in approved source data.

## Public Boundary

| Layer | Public Scout responsibility |
|---|---|
| Source access | Generic SQL, REST, CSV, file, and mock-safe connector paths. |
| Selector engine | Rules that map approved source fields into semantic attributes. |
| Semantic schema | Canonical attributes, data types, confidence, freshness, and provenance. |
| Context records | User, account, fact, snapshot, package, audit, and recomputation records. |
| API surfaces | Authenticated GraphQL, REST v1, legacy REST, TypeScript SDK, and .NET SDK. |
| Admin console | Local React admin/demo console for schemas, selectors, sources, and context. |

Private enterprise connector implementations, customer-specific mappings,
managed deployment code, private engine internals, and proprietary roadmap
material are intentionally outside the Scout repository.

## Runtime Shape

```text
Approved source systems
  -> connector plugin
  -> raw payload and provenance
  -> selector execution
  -> semantic facts
  -> governed evidence package
  -> context snapshots and packages
  -> GraphQL / REST / SDK consumers
```

The API is an ASP.NET Core application. The admin console is a Vite React
application. Persistence uses Entity Framework Core with SQLite for local
evaluation and PostgreSQL for production-style self-hosting.

## Data Planes And Control Planes

Scout is designed as a customer data plane. Customer operational data,
connector credentials, context facts, evidence packages, snapshots, and audit data stay inside
the self-hosted Scout environment.

The public repo also contains metadata types used for SaaS-style account,
workspace, licence, API-client, billing-usage, and onboarding records. In
the open-source repo these are public-safe data-plane foundations, not a
hosted control-plane deployment promise.

## Core Projects

| Project | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/KynticAI.Scout.Api` | ASP.NET Core API, auth, REST, GraphQL, OpenAPI, health checks. |
| `src/KynticAI.Scout.Application` | Contracts, service interfaces, validation, selector inputs/results. |
| `src/KynticAI.Scout.Domain` | Domain entities, enums, and semantic attribute constants. |
| `src/KynticAI.Scout.Infrastructure` | EF Core persistence, connectors, auth services, seed data, jobs. |
| `src/KynticAI.Scout.Sdk` | Typed .NET SDK. |
| `packages/typescript/scout-sdk` | Typed TypeScript SDK. |
| `apps/web` | React admin/demo console. |

## Trust Model

Scout treats context as governed data, not as a free-form prompt cache.
Important controls include:

- tenant-scoped API access
- role and API-client scope checks
- protected connector credentials
- selector validation before execution
- confidence and freshness on facts
- audit records for context and administration activity
- provenance on facts and context packages
- support for next-best-action evidence packs without sending raw data to Cloud
- production readiness checks for unsafe development settings

## Open Source And Enterprise

Scout defines the public extension contracts. KynticAI Fortress is the
commercial enterprise edition and lives outside this repository. The public
docs describe only the category boundary: vendor-specific connectors,
enterprise identity, managed deployment support, and advanced governance
belong outside Scout.

See [Open Source vs Enterprise](/concepts/open-source-vs-enterprise/) for
the support boundary and [Connector Authoring](/connectors/authoring/) for
the public connector contract.

## Source Of Truth

The architecture described here is grounded in the public solution layout,
the ASP.NET Core API in `src/KynticAI.Scout.Api`, the application contracts
in `src/KynticAI.Scout.Application`, the EF Core persistence model in
`src/KynticAI.Scout.Infrastructure`, and the SDKs under `src/` and
`packages/typescript/`. Future diagrams should be generated only from
public repository structure and must not imply private enterprise internals.
