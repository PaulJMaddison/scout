## Project Overview

KynticAI Scout is the open-source public repo for the Universal Context Layer. It is MIT-licensed and provides the public data-plane foundation: .NET API, TypeScript SDK, .NET SDK, React admin console, connector abstractions, docs, samples, and demo tooling.

Scout is the public face of KynticAI. Keep it useful, auditable, and safe for public release. It must not contain enterprise-only implementation details or private planning material.

## Repo Topology

- `src/` - .NET API, application, domain, infrastructure, and SDK projects.
- `tests/` - .NET unit, integration, SDK, and end-to-end tests.
- `apps/web/` - Vite React admin/demo console.
- `packages/typescript/scout-sdk/` - public TypeScript SDK.
- `docs/` - public documentation, API notes, diagrams, and brand assets.
- `deploy/` - Docker and deployment configuration.
- `scripts/` - local setup, demo, and automation scripts.
- `samples/` - public example integrations and fixtures.

## Build/Test Commands

- Restore/build/test .NET: `dotnet restore .\KynticAI.Scout.slnx`, `dotnet build .\KynticAI.Scout.slnx`, `dotnet test .\KynticAI.Scout.slnx`.
- Web app: `cd apps\web`, then `npm install`, `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test`.
- TypeScript SDK: `cd packages\typescript\scout-sdk`, then `npm install`, `npm run build`, `npm run test`.
- Local demo: `.\scripts\setup-demo.ps1`, then `.\scripts\start-demo.ps1`.
- Docker API demo: `docker compose -f deploy\docker-compose.yml up scout-api --build`.

## Do-Not-Do List

- Do not add enterprise internals, private connector code, proprietary Fortress logic, LanceDB, embedded LLMs, vector pipelines, or obfuscation logic to Scout.
- Do not add stubs, placeholder implementations, fake integrations, TODO-only paths, or demo shortcuts and present them as finished work.
- Do not leak private planning docs, customer material, credentials, tokens, service-account files, or paid-customer details.
- Do not change package names, public API contracts, or SDK shapes without compatibility notes and tests.
- Do not add user-facing copy that says plain "Kyntic" when it means the public brand.
- Do not publish releases, tags, packages, or public deployment changes without explicit approval.
- Do not introduce telemetry that sends customer data to third parties.

## Commercial Quality Bar

- Every implementation must be commercial-standard code: real behaviour, typed errors, compatibility-aware public contracts, safe defaults, and focused tests for the changed behaviour.
- If a live dependency, dataset, credential, or external service is unavailable, implement the public boundary cleanly, mark the task partial, document the blocker in `C:\Kyntic\UCL-local-aidocs\SESSION_LOG.md`, and do not hide the gap behind a stub.
- Prefer small complete public-safe slices over broad incomplete scaffolding.

## Review/Test Gates

- Use xhigh review gates for public API, SDK, connector-contract, data-model, or security-sensitive changes before marking them complete.
- When Scout work depends on Fortress Rust engine contracts, do not treat the integration as complete until the relevant engine change has passed the review policy in `C:\Kyntic\UCL-local-aidocs\RUST_ENGINE_REVIEW_POLICY.md`.
- Prefer slower, meaningful verification over quick unchecked completion. Log tests run, skipped tests, and residual risk.
- Routine .NET integration/E2E tests must stay local and deterministic: use EF InMemory or in-memory SQLite, not Docker, Postgres, Redis, MongoDB, or vendor services. Any future live dependency proof must be explicit opt-in and logged.

## Brand Rules

- Public brand is `KynticAI`, always with `AI`.
- Product tier name is `KynticAI Scout`.
- Use British English for user-facing copy.
- Public positioning: context infrastructure for AI-enabled products. Scout does not call an AI model.
- Keep the Aged Book/Sovereign Rust visual direction when touching public UI or docs.
- Hard logo rule: every public image, screenshot, social card, README graphic, or generated marketing asset must use the approved KynticAI logo file (`docs/images/brand/kynticai-logo-mark.png` or `docs/images/brand/kynticai-logo-lockup.png`). Do not redraw, approximate, or AI-generate the logo; overlay the approved file after generating any background imagery.

## Current Sprint Priorities

- V2-003: keep this root AGENTS.md current after meaningful sessions.
- OSS-021: keep user-facing brand text aligned to `KynticAI`.
- OSS-013: re-enable and harden CI/CD when that work is picked up.
- OSS-015 and OSS-019: public docs and connector authoring remain upcoming public-facing work.

## State/Update Expectations

- Check `git status` before editing and preserve unrelated local changes.
- Read nearby code and existing docs before changing behaviour or public wording.
- Keep updates concise in `C:\Kyntic\UCL-local-aidocs\SESSION_LOG.md` after meaningful work.
- Record commands run, verification results, and any skipped checks.
- Keep this file under 200 lines and public-safe.
