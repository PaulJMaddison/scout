# UCL Evidence Pack Contract v1

Product framing note: `UclEvidencePackV1` is an existing implementation contract name. The canonical UCL product story is relationship sets and attribution paths first: exact data items are linked, journeys are ordered, comparable relationship sets can be analysed by private extensions, and governed JSON is handed to a customer-owned LLM, workflow, app, or agent for explanation.

`UclEvidencePackV1` is the stable local evidence-pack contract for Scout/UCL cross-repo use. It is emitted inside the customer-owned data plane and may contain exact authorised records, citations, provenance, relationships, `BasicRelationshipEngine` fallback weighted signals, recommendations, caveats, draft response content, and governance decisions.

`UclCloudAggregateUsageV1` is a separate Cloud/control-plane usage contract. It carries aggregate usage metadata only: package version, tenant/control-plane slug, feature/event/status, timestamps, feature counters, governance counters, and explicit data-boundary flags. It must not contain records, facts, snapshots, evidence packs, prompts, generated content, recommendations, citations, relationship types, weighted signals, caveats, hashed subject/account identifiers, or per-customer derived intelligence.

`UclEnterpriseRelationshipEngineHandoffV1` is a legacy-named proof-mode handoff contract for private relationship-set analysis. It is generated from local relationship/evidence JSON and stays in the customer-owned data plane. Scout does not call a live private service in open-core proof mode; it emits candidate relationships, citation provenance, fallback weight scope, and required private-extension outputs so a proof runner can apply advanced relationship-set analysis separately.

## Enterprise Analysis Boundary

Scout may include `BasicRelationshipEngine` public fallback weights in the local `UclEvidencePackV1` payload so open-core tests and demos remain executable. Those weights are not canonical. The local pack includes `relationshipWeighting` metadata with `scope: "basic-public-fallback-only"` and `scoutWeightsAreCanonical: false`.

For proof mode, `EnterpriseRelationshipEngineHandoff` emits the legacy-named `UclEnterpriseRelationshipEngineHandoffV1` beside the local evidence pack. A private proof runner can consume that handoff, or the original `UclEvidencePackV1`, as the stable input for advanced relationship-set analysis, attribution paths, comparable examples, and outcome patterns. Private extensions must not require Cloud to receive local evidence packs or derived customer intelligence.

The handoff includes `requiresLiveEnterpriseService: false` and `enterpriseOnlyInternalsIncluded: false`. It must not contain private canonical formulae, scoring configuration, vector/index paths, embeddings, or private weighting internals.

Clarity and Importance are separate products and are not required by this contract.

## Fixture Coverage

The v1 golden fixtures cover B2B SaaS, ecommerce, support churn, recruitment, finance retention, and healthcare operations. Healthcare fixtures are operational and synthetic only; they do not include patient-level data.

Unit tests in `tests/KynticAI.Scout.UnitTests/UclEvidencePackContractTests.cs` validate the golden fixtures, citation/provenance integrity, masking behaviour, Cloud aggregate exclusions, private-extension handoff shape, and rejection of deliberately unsafe Cloud payload examples.
